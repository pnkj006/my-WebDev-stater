        <h3>
            The "preload" attribute can have the following values:
        </h3>
        <li>
            none: This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio file at all. The
            audio file will only start downloading when the user initiates playback.
        </li>
        <li>
            metadata: This value tells the browser to preload only the metadata of the audio file, such as its duration
            and basic information about the audio. This can be useful if you want to display the audio duration to the
            user without fully loading the audio data.
        </li>
        <li>
            auto: This value instructs the browser to preload the entire audio file as much as possible without delaying
            the loading of other important page content. The browser will try to load the audio file in the background
            so that it's ready to play when the user decides to start it.

        SVG in HTML
    </h2>
    <p>
    <p>
        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has become an indispensable part of modern web development. SVG enables
        developers to create high-quality, scalable graphics that look crisp at any size or resolution. In this blog
        post, we'll explore the basics of using SVG in HTML, its benefits, and some practical examples.
    </p>

    <h3>
        What is SVG?
    </h3>
    <p>
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Unlike raster images like PNGs or JPGs, SVGs are not pixel-based.
        They're composed of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas that describe shapes, paths, and fills. This means SVGs can be
        resized without losing quality.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why Use SVG?
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>

            Scalability
        </li>
        SVG images can be scaled indefinitely without losing quality, which is ideal for responsive web design.
        <li>

            File Size
        </li>
        SVG files are often smaller than their raster counterparts, especially for simple shapes and icons.
        <li>

            Flexibility
        </li>
        SVGs can be styled, animated, and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.
    </ul>
    <h3>


        How to Embed SVG in HTML
    </h3>
    SVG can be embedded in HTML in several ways:
    <ul>

        <li>

            Inline SVG: Directly writing the SVG XML code within HTML.
        </li>
        <li>

            Using an <img> tag: Point the src attribute to an SVG file.
        </li>
        <li>

            Using CSS: Setting SVG as a background image in a CSS file.
        </li>
    </ul>
