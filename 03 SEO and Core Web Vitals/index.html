    <h1>Core Web Vitals</h1>
    <h2>what is SEO?</h2>
    <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of improving a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) to attract more organic (unpaid) traffic. It involves optimizing various aspects of a website, including its content, structure, and technical elements, to make it more appealing to both users and search engines. The goal is to rank higher in search results for relevant keywords, ultimately driving more qualified traffic to the site. </p>
    <h2>what is LCP?</h2>
    <p>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a user-centric performance metric that measures how long it takes for the largest content element on a webpage to become visible in the user's viewport. It's a key part of Google's Core Web Vitals and helps assess the perceived loading speed of a page. A faster LCP generally leads to a better user experience as it gives the impression that the page loaded quickly. </p>
    <h2>what is FID(first input delay)?</h2>
    <p>First Input Delay (FID) is a web performance metric that measures the time it takes for a browser to respond to a user's first interaction with a webpage, such as a click or tap. Specifically, it measures the time between the user's first interaction and the moment the browser's main thread becomes idle enough to begin processing that interaction. A lower FID indicates better responsiveness and a smoother user experience. </p>
